# AGENTS.md - Codex CLI Instructions

## Development Workflow (Source of Truth)

**Use `/workflow` to execute the full development lifecycle.** It sequences 8 stages: ideation → spec + ADR → plan → implement → review → revision → compound → reflection.

The conductor skill dispatches to stage-specific skills at each step. Run `/workflow <idea>` to start a new workflow, or `/workflow` to resume an in-progress one.

### Key Rules (always apply)

1. **Specs go in `specs/`** (not `.specs/`). ADRs use the HDD lifecycle: `.adr/staging/` → `.adr/accepted/` or `.adr/rejected/`.
2. **Code and spec updates in the same commit.** If you change code that a spec describes, update the spec in the same commit.
3. **Atomic commits.** One sub-agent = one bead = one unit of work = one commit, made after review validates the work.
4. **Sub-agent summaries use the structured format** defined in the `/workflow` conductor skill (Claims, Hypothesis Alignment, Tests, Known Gaps, Risks).
5. **Default: human is NOT in the loop.** Operate autonomously up to the escalation thresholds defined in `agentic-dev-team/agentic-dev-team-spec.md`. Escalate only when those thresholds are met.
6. **Orchestrators don't do manual work.** Deploy sub-agents or agent teams. Protect your context window.

### Stage Skills

| Stage | Skill | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 1. Ideation | `/workflow-ideation` | Evaluate whether idea is worth implementing |
| 2. Dev-Time Docs | `/hdd` | Create spec and ADR via HDD process |
| 3. Planning | `/workflows:plan` | Plan implementation approach |
| 4. Implementation | `/workflows:work` | Execute the plan with sub-agents |
| 5. Review | `/workflows:review` | Verify claims and test hypotheses |
| 6. Revision | `/workflow-revision` | Fix review findings, loop until pass |
| 7. Compound | `/workflows:compound` | Capture learnings |
| 8. Reflection | `/workflow-reflection` | Finalize ADRs, close issues, merge |

## Branch Rules for Agents

The full branching strategy (GitHub Flow) is defined in `docs/WORKFLOW-MASTER-DESCRIPTION.md` § Branching Strategy. These are the agent-specific enforcement rules:

1. **Before first commit: verify branch scope matches work.**
   - `git branch --show-current` — check where you are
   - `fix/X` branches are for fixing X — not for new features
   - `feat/X` branches are for feature X — not for unrelated fixes
   - If scope doesn't match, create a new branch from `main`
2. **Every branch MUST have a corresponding bead.** Create the bead before creating the branch.
3. **Branch name MUST match the bead's subject** (e.g., bead "Fix gateway timeout" → `fix/gateway-timeout`).
4. **After PR is merged: delete the branch** (local + remote). This is not optional.
5. **Never create branches with timestamps, UUIDs, or auto-generated suffixes.**
6. **Never commit to `main` directly.**
7. **Never commit to `beads-sync`.**
8. **Plans must include branch creation as Step 0** when the work is a new unit.

Committing unrelated work to an existing branch pollutes PRs, makes reverts dangerous, creates merge conflicts, and makes git history useless for archaeology. **This is non-negotiable.**

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) for issue tracking. Issues live in `.beads/` and are tracked in git.

Two CLIs: **bd** (issue CRUD) and **bv** (graph-aware triage, read-only).

### bd: Issue Management

```bash
bd ready              # Unblocked issues ready to work
bd list --status=open # All open issues
bd show <id>          # Full details with dependencies
bd create --title="..." --type=task --priority=2
bd update <id> --status=in_progress
bd close <id>         # Mark complete
bd close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple
bd dep add <a> <b>    # a depends on b
bd sync               # Sync with git
```

### bv: Graph Analysis (read-only)

**NEVER run bare `bv`** — it launches interactive TUI. Always use `--robot-*` flags:

```bash
bv --robot-triage     # Ranked picks, quick wins, blockers, health
bv --robot-next       # Single top pick + claim command
bv --robot-plan       # Parallel execution tracks
bv --robot-alerts     # Stale issues, cascades, mismatches
bv --robot-insights   # Full graph metrics: PageRank, betweenness, cycles
```

### Workflow

1. **Start**: `bd ready` (or `bv --robot-triage` for graph analysis)
2. **Claim**: `bd update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: `bd close <id>`
5. **Sync**: `bd sync` at session end

### Session Close Protocol

```bash
git status            # Check what changed
git add <files>       # Stage code changes
bd sync               # Commit beads changes
git commit -m "..."   # Commit code
bd sync               # Commit any new beads changes
git push              # Push to remote
```

### Key Concepts

- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (numbers only)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Dependencies**: `bd ready` shows only unblocked work
